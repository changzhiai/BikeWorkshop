    "\n",
    "A Genetic algorithm (GA) takes a Darwinistic approach to optimization by maintaining a *population* of solution *candidates* to a problem (e.g. what is the best chemical ordering of a multi-component system).\n",
    "- The population is evolved to obtain better solutions by mating and mutating selected candidates and putting the fittest *offspring* in the population.\n",
    "- The *fitness* of a candidate is a function which, for example, measures the stability or performance of a candidate.\n",
    "- Natural selection is used to keep a constant population size by removing the least fit candidates.\n",
    "- Mating or *crossover* combine candidates to create offspring with parts from more candidates present, when favorable traits are combined and passed on the population is evolved. However, only performing crossover operations risks stagnating the evolution due to a lack of diversity -- performing crossover on very similar candidates is unlikely to create progress when performed repeatedly.\n",
    "- *Mutation* induces diversity in the population and thus prevents premature convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below gives a simplified outline of the algorithm.\n",

    "![ga-outline](images/ga-outline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "GAs are generally applicable to areas where traditional optimization by derivative methods are unsuited and a brute force approach is computationally infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the output of a GA run will be a selection of optimized candidates, which often will be preferred over only getting the best candidate, especially taking into account the potential inaccuracy of the employed methods. Thus a GA finds many applications within atomic simulations, and will often be one of the best methods for searching large phase spaces."

    "[Castelli et al](http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c2ee22341d) performed a density functional theory (DFT) screening of $\\sim$19000 perovskite materials. Only a small number of the calculated candidate materials ($\\sim$20) were found to be sufficiently interesting for photocatalytic water splitting to warrant further experimental investigation. A genetic algorithm could reduce the number of calculations required to locate the interesting candidates. We will try to make 19000 into ?\n",

    "GA is now commonly used as an efficient global optimization approach for bimetallic nanoparticles. The GA search starts by randomly generating a set of atomic configurations of bimetallic nanoparticles, which is defined as the population. Throughout the whole GA search, the size of the population always remains constant. Next, the candidates of the population perform genetic operations including crossover, mutation and selection, to obtain offsprings which constitutes evolving a generation. Crossover operators acts by juxtaposing two different motifs from each participating parent and thereby creating two offsprings with inherited properties. Mutation operators introduce a random small structural change to a chosen parent so that favorable genetic structures can be discovered. All the individual candidates are ranked according to the mixing energy, where lower mixing energies are assigned with higher fitness. By selecting suitable operators and optimal hyperparameters, the GA evolves towards an optimal population in which the structures with lower fitness are eliminated and all remaining structures are low in mixing energy, i.e., thermodynamically stable. The figures below showcase two types of GA run, one with a fixed composition and the other with all possible compositions.\n",
